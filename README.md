**Electricity and Emissions: Wind Turbines using Python (wind turbine.py)**

**This program calculates the amount of electricity generated by wind turbines based on user input for wind speed and the number of turbines.**
**It uses the calculate_electricity function to calculate the electricity generated.**
**Then, it uses the homes_powered function to calculate the number of homes that can be powered by the electricity generated.**
**Finally, it calculates and displays the CO2 emissions saved based on the electricity generated.**

**-----------------------------------------**

**POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS**

- Include the ability to enter a range of wind speeds or an average and recognizing what's been entered accordingly

- Combine this with more Windmill data, land usage, precipitation in  a similar way to wind, turbine size and blade size

- Eventually include a database of devices, machines, vehicles, equipment for emissions (potentially) and electricity needed to power them instead of just homes

- Allow the user to choose combine this program with graphs and wider functionality for the user to calculate other renewable energies and show potentially the non-renewable sources as well such as oil, natural gas, or maybe just a wider range of databases to pull from

**-----------------------------------------**

**This Python program is designed to calculate the amount of electricity generated by wind turbines based on user input for wind speed, number of turbines, and duration. The program uses the following three functions:**

- **calculate_electricity(wind_speed_mph, number_of_turbines, duration):** 
This function takes three input parameters and returns the power generated in kW. It first converts wind speed in mph to m/s and then calculates the power generated using the following formula: coefficient_of_power * air_density (kg/m^3) * wind speed ^3 (m/s) * number of turbines. The coefficient_of_power is randomly generated within a range based on EPA calculations. The function then multiplies the power generated by the duration to get the total electricity generated and returns it.

- **homes_powered(electricity):** 
This function takes the total electricity generated in kWh and returns the number of homes that can be powered by that electricity. The function calculates this value by dividing the electricity generated by the average annual electricity consumption of a home in the US, which is 11,000 kWh per year.

- **main():** 
This function is the main program that takes user input for wind speed, number of turbines, and duration using the input() function. It then calls the calculate_electricity() function with the user input and rounds the result to three decimal places. It also calls the homes_powered() function with the electricity generated and rounds the result to three decimal places. Finally, it calculates and displays the CO2 emissions saved based on the electricity generated. The CO2 emissions are calculated based on the average kg of CO2 emitted per kWh of electricity and are displayed in both kg and tons.
